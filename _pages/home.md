### Welcome!

My research is focused on the numerical modelling and simulation of turbulent reacting and nonreacting flows. In addition to studying fundamental physics of turbulence and combustion, I am also interested in developing computationally efficient models which can be used to accelerate the predictive design of net-zero energy systems. Of particular interest is the use of alternative fuels such as carbon-free and sustainable aviation fuels for energy generation and propulsion applications.

### About me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University where I work with <a href="https://ctrfl.princeton.edu/">Prof. Michael E Mueller</a> developing efficient computational models to predict soot and emissions production. Prior to this, I completed my PhD at Caltech under the supervision of <a href="https://theforce.caltech.edu/">Prof. Guillaume Blanquart</a> where I studed fundamental physics of turbulent combustion and reduced order combustion modelling, and my MASc at uWaterloo under the supervision of <a href="https://www.mpilab.ca/home">Prof. Jean-Pierre Hickey</a> where I studied fundamental combustion dynamics and turbulent wall-bounded flows.
